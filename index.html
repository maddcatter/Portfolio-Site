			    <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>For more than a decade I have been writing short fiction and poetry while pursuing its publication in my
				spare time. In 2008 I earned a  Bachelor's of Liberal Studies from the University of Memphis with
				concentrations in English and Art History. After graduating I started my own business, a small publishing
				company which produced a quarterly magazine featuring short dark fiction, poetry, and art. In addition,
				I volunteered for several years for successful local non-profit where my duties included writing
				promotional and marketing materials for my department. While there I also co-authored several successful
				proposals that expanded our services and boosted attendance at our events.</p>

			    <h2>Interests</h2>
			    <p>My passion is creating things! I love writing and seeing my work in print. I enjoy fiber arts like
				sewing, quilting, and knitting. At different times I've dabbled in painting and glass fusing. Since
				working in a photo lab (back when digital photography was in its infancy) I've reveled in documenting
				my world through photography. My first love though, was music; I spent my childhood and teenage years
				as a violinist.</p>
