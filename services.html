          <p>
              As a writer and publisher I attended conventions and conferences as a professional speaker. For several
              years I served as a conference organizer which required me to not only select and schedule speakers, but to
              act as a moderator for panel discussions. These experiences allowed me to acquire a unique skill set.

              Many people find it personally fulfilling to give back to their professional communities by speaking at
              conferences and writing articles and blog posts. Maybe you don't consider yourself a "writer," but are an
              expert in your field. Its not unusual to see a disconnect between the tone and grammar of your written
              word and the natural flow of your speech.
              <br>
              <br>
              As your editor, I can smooth out the rough edges of your draft whether it's a conversational tone lecture
              or a more formal journal article.
