                 <h2>Midnight Screaming</h2>
                <p>Midnight Screaming was a quarterly dark fiction magazine I curated, edited, and typeset for four years.
                    The later issues were also available as ebooks which I formatted for Kindle and Nook.</p>

                <h2>Russwood Park Sports Bar & Grill</h2>
                <p>This downtown Memphis restaurant had an existing menu and a layout they wanted to keep. They wanted to
                    update their menu items, but no longer had their source files. I recreated their menu and added the
                    new items.</p>
