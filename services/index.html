                    As a writer and publisher I attended conventions and conferences as a professional speaker. For several
                    years I served as a conference organizer which required me to not only select and schedule speakers, but to
                    act as a moderator for panel discussions. These experiences allowed me to acquire a unique skill set.

                     Many people find it personally fulfilling to give back to their professional communities by speaking at
                    conferences and writing articles and blog posts. Maybe you don't consider yourself a "writer," but are an
                    expert in your field. Its not unusual to see a disconnect between the tone and grammar of your written
                    word and the natural flow of your speech.

                    As your editor, I can smooth out the rough edges of your draft whether it's a conversational tone lecture
                    or a more formal journal article.
